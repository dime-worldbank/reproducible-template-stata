d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

d 'ESTOUT': module to make regression tables
d 
d  estout produces a table of regression results from one or
d several models for use with spreadsheets, LaTeX, HTML, or a
d word-processor table. eststo stores a quick copy of the active
d estimation results for later tabulation. esttab is a wrapper for
d estout. It displays a pretty looking publication-style regression
d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and
d stored. This package subsumes the previously circulated esto,
d esta, estadd,  and estadd_plus. An earlier version of estout is
d available  as estout1.

d 'COEFPLOT': module to plot regression coefficients and other results
d 
d   coefplot plots results from estimation commands or Stata
d matrices. Results from multiple models or matrices can be
d combined in a single graph. The default behavior of coefplot is
d to draw markers for coefficients and horizontal spikes for
d confidence intervals. However, coefplot can also produce various
d other types of graphs.
